The front side of the PCB is the side with the dragon and pictures of the placement 
of all the components exept the GPIO header conn13x2.
Some soldering experience is neccesary, there are many "how to"'s on the net.
If you are unsure, ask a Amateur radio operator for help or guidance.

1:
Solder all the 330 ohm resistors first.
They are : R2, R4, R5, R6, and R7 on the PCB.
2:
Solder the 100K ohm resistors R3 and R9.
3:
Solder resistor R1 (10 Kohm) and R10 (1Kohm), and R8 (300Kohm).
4:
Solder C1 and C3 (0.1uF).
5:
Solder C4 (10uF) and C2 (1uF).
6:
Solder D3, D4, D6, D7, D8, D9, 3.3V zener diodes. The cathode must point accordingly to the pictures on the PCB.
The thin line or double bottom on the symbol depicts the cathode.
7:
Solder the diode D1.The cathode must point accordingly to the picture on the PCB.
8:
Solder LEDs D2, D5, D10, D11, D12.
They must have the flat side facing upwards to the UPLOAD switch.
9:
Solder Conn13x2, it is on the Reverse side of the PCB.
10:
Solder the FET's on the normal side of the PCB.
They are IRF540N and IRF9540N
11:
Solder the USB connectors.
12:
Solder SW1, SW2. 
13:
Install a short wire connecting the center solder pad(AUTO) of JP1 and the one marked ONN.
This causes the Piwardrive to power up the Rasberry Pi automaticly.
If you want it to stay off until the ON/OFF button is pressed, connect AUTO to OFF.
14: Install a USB to MINI USB connecting the USB that is located above 
the UPLOAD button to the Rasberry Pi's mini usb connector.
Plug in a USB cable that supplies power to the connector located over the ON/OFF button.
15:
Plug in the Extender ( 26 pin ) in to the header soldered on the Piwardrive, this is needed to achieve the necceary
disctance so the Piwardrive clears the USB connectors and components on the Raspberry.
You may need two of these.


Options:
SW1, SW2.can be subsituted for a pair of momentairly Single pole, double trow switches if you 
want to mount them on the outside surface of a box. Digi-Key Part Number  360-1182-ND is a example a switch useable.
The Diodes can also be mounted in the same manner, if they are connected remotely to the PCB boards.
It is the neccesary to mount them in Diode holders, Digi-Key Part Number  67-1333-ND is suitable. 
There are many variants, in crome or black plastic, or grey plastic.
The GPIO header can be extended with a extention cable if needed. 
You will need a suitable set of non conducting spacers and non conducting mounting hardware for that.
There is a pair of suitable holes on the PCB.
