Create a script that is launced automaticly on boot,or perhaps 3 seconds after.
The script should start up kismet and gpsd on boot ( if it is not possible to do that with dpkg-reconfigure).
The process is documented here:
http://www.megaleecher.net/Raspberry_Pi_Autostart
Make assembly instructions for the PCB and write a list of needed components for the Piwardrive PCB.
Assembly at least on of the prototype PCB's and test it.
